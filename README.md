# MIFAP
Final project for Advanced Scheduling Systems course.

# Objective
To study the state of the art of [Minimum Interference Frequency Assignment](http://fap.zib.de/flavors/) problem, design and implement algorithmic solutions.

# Solution
The problem is tackled via [Tabu Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search) and [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) techniques.  
The implementation is based on [EasyLocal++](https://bitbucket.org/satt/easylocal-3/src/master/) framework.
